Intel Remote System Update (RSU) for Stratix10 SoC FPGAs
============================================
The Intel Remote System Update (RSU) driver exposes interfaces
accessed through the Intel Service Layer to user space via SysFS
device attribute nodes. The RSU interfaces report/control some of
the optional RSU features of the Stratix 10 SoC FPGA.

The RSU feature provides a way for customers to update the boot
configuration of a Stratix 10 SoC device with significantly reduced
risk of corrupting the bitstream storage and bricking the system.

Required properties:
-------------------
The intel-rsu node has the following mandatory properties and must be located
under the firmware/svc node.

- compatible: "intel,stratix10-rsu"

Example:
-------

	firmware {
		svc {
			rsu {
				compatible = "intel,stratix10-rsu";
			};
		};
	};
